12/14/18, 5:06 PM - uv: let's not do that
12/14/18, 5:06 PM - uv: that seems like an extreme step
12/14/18, 5:11 PM - le nyom: well
12/14/18, 5:11 PM - le nyom: oops
12/14/18, 5:23 PM - uv: you've applied to other places as well

12/14/18, 5:24 PM - le nyom: yes but i want to get in there
12/14/18, 5:24 PM - uv: and that isn't the right attitude
12/14/18, 5:24 PM - uv: so what if you don't get in there
12/14/18, 5:24 PM - uv: the world won't end
12/14/18, 5:25 PM - le nyom: I'll die
12/14/18, 5:25 PM - le nyom: yes thanks I knew that but still I don't want to go to manipal it's so
12/14/18, 5:25 PM - le nyom: incredibly shitty for humanities
12/14/18, 5:25 PM - uv: but why
12/14/18, 5:26 PM - uv: then apply to more places
12/14/18, 5:26 PM - le nyom: because I want a decent education jeEz
12/14/18, 5:26 PM - le nyom: where tho
12/14/18, 5:26 PM - uv: have you only applied to three colleges
12/14/18, 5:26 PM - uv: but why
12/14/18, 5:26 PM - uv: Ashoka isn't the only place which offers a good education
12/14/18, 5:27 PM - le nyom: ashoka, manipal, azim premji
12/14/18, 5:27 PM - le nyom: it's one of the only places that I can maybe realistically get into
12/14/18, 5:28 PM - uv: why have you only applied to three then
12/14/18, 5:28 PM - uv: apply to the Netherlands as well
12/14/18, 5:28 PM - le nyom: there's only three places with history programs in English
12/14/18, 5:29 PM - le nyom: and I have to go write the toefl first idk when I'll do that
12/14/18, 5:29 PM - le nyom: basically yeah I suck
12/14/18, 5:29 PM - uv: stop making excuses
12/14/18, 5:29 PM - uv: go write the toefl then
12/14/18, 5:29 PM - uv: you can't apply to only three colleges then say oh no I didn't get in anywhere I wanted to
12/14/18, 5:30 PM - le nyom: I'm not making excuse uv, staying in India is so so so much cheaper and there's only so many options for me here
12/14/18, 5:31 PM - le nyom: why would I spend like 15k writing the toefl for places I don't even want to go to
12/14/18, 5:31 PM - uv: then spend more money
12/14/18, 5:32 PM - uv: I know it's cheaper but nobody said a good education wasn't expensive
12/14/18, 5:32 PM - le nyom: that's the dumbest thing you've ever said
12/14/18, 5:32 PM - uv: even Toronto is comparatively much more expensive and you've applied there
12/14/18, 5:32 PM - uv: no it isn't
12/14/18, 5:32 PM - uv: it's an investment in your future
12/14/18, 5:32 PM - le nyom: I know but even if I get in I probably won't go
12/14/18, 5:33 PM - le nyom: okay mate forget it I don't have money to invest rn it's rlly not that difficult to comprehend
12/14/18, 5:39 PM - uv: no it is difficult to comprehend
12/14/18, 5:39 PM - uv: you spend like four lakh a year on Shilp already
12/14/18, 5:39 PM - uv: are you saying that's all you can pay for college as well
12/14/18, 5:41 PM - le nyom: ok uv you're right I'm sorry you know more about my financial situation right now than I do
12/14/18, 5:41 PM - le nyom: pls forgive
12/14/18, 5:45 PM - uv: then tell me what your financial situation is
12/14/18, 5:46 PM - uv: I doubt you'd have applied to Toronto without any way of paying for it
12/14/18, 5:46 PM - uv: and that your mom wasn't involved in the process at all
12/14/18, 5:46 PM - uv: and you would've spent 8 or 9 k on the Toronto application where you're saying you won't go even if you get in
12/14/18, 5:47 PM - le nyom: I applied to u of t when I thought my dad would pay for it
12/14/18, 5:48 PM - le nyom: I would talk to you about it if I wanted to and I don't so, no
12/14/18, 5:48 PM - le nyom: why am I supposed to justify how poor I am to you what the fuck
12/14/18, 5:51 PM - uv: because your logic wasn't making sense and it seemed that you simply didn't want to pay for a good education beyond Ashoka
12/14/18, 5:51 PM - uv: and even only within India, I still have no idea why you've only applied to three places
12/14/18, 5:52 PM - le nyom: flame doesn't offer history at all, I might apply to krea
12/14/18, 5:52 PM - le nyom: where else would you like me to apply
12/14/18, 5:52 PM - le nyom: xaviers and all is only in april
12/14/18, 5:53 PM - uv: I just think you aren't applying to enough places
12/14/18, 5:54 PM - uv: three, four, five places isn't a guarantee of anything
12/14/18, 5:55 PM - le nyom: there's only so many humanities unis in India what would you like me to do
12/14/18, 5:56 PM - uv: I am sure there are more than five places in India that offer humanities
12/14/18, 5:56 PM - uv: drop it anyway
12/14/18, 5:56 PM - uv: this conversation isn't going anywhere
12/14/18, 5:56 PM - le nyom: yes I fucking know that uv I'll apply to mount carmel if it comes to that
12/14/18, 5:59 PM - uv: I don't know why you're acting as if applying to only the five best places for humanities is the right thing to do
12/14/18, 5:59 PM - uv: everybody applies to safeties
12/14/18, 6:00 PM - le nyom: manipal and Azim Premji are my safeties...
12/14/18, 6:01 PM - le nyom: I didn't apply to the five best places

12/14/18, 6:01 PM - le nyom: place
12/14/18, 6:01 PM - le nyom: what's your problem honestly
12/14/18, 6:01 PM - uv: and you'll kill yourself if you don't get into that one place
12/14/18, 6:02 PM - uv: you're just not being realistic
12/14/18, 6:02 PM - uv: drop it
12/14/18, 9:10 PM - le nyom: ok dropped

1/3/19, 4:54 PM - uv: do you think he could've construed your no as a response to shut up
1/3/19, 4:55 PM - le nyom: maybe
1/3/19, 4:55 PM - le nyom: ya you're probably right
1/3/19, 4:55 PM - uv: I'm trying to justify it because Dhruvan is one of the people I'd least expect it from
1/3/19, 4:56 PM - le nyom: I know me too
1/3/19, 4:56 PM - uv: but if you don't think that's the case then you can say so

1/3/19, 4:58 PM - uv: fair enough
1/3/19, 4:58 PM - uv: honestly I would think that this is the case

1/6/19, 11:44 PM - uv: We still don‚Äôt fully understand how Inika conned Mr. Vasu into giving her a predicted A with a midterm percentage of fifty (sorry, Karan). But that‚Äôs just one of Inika‚Äôs many talents.
One of those is survival. With a herd of tubes constantly hounding her, it‚Äôs remarkable how she survives every entanglement with door handles. But we think we do have an answer for that. Her sneezes, aggressively loud and clearly trying to kill us through shock, drives away the herd. 
It is impossible to keep Inika quiet, and that is a wonderful thing. Nobody livens up a class the way she does. She is, quite simply, of the funniest people we‚Äôve ever had the privilege of meeting, and it‚Äôs a shame that Mr. Thomas never did tell her whether he‚Äôd choose series resistances or his wife. 
And there‚Äôs so much more than just funny. She‚Äôs incredible at crying and defending her trusty sporkife while at the same time eating ketchup, probably straight out of the bottle. She is, however, terrible at keto diets, wearing blue t-shirts, and drawing positive-gradient graphs. Just goes to show that nobody‚Äôs perfect.
But Inika comes close. Right beneath her humour lies a heart of gold, filled with love, warmth, and friendship in equal and great quantity. She‚Äôs someone who lights up everyone‚Äôs mood, regardless of how she‚Äôs feeling. She‚Äôs someone who can be trusted with your deepest, darkest secret, and you can be assured that she‚Äôll be the world‚Äôs best confidant. And you can be assured that she is one of the most dependable and hardworking people you will ever meet. There‚Äôs a reason she was chosen to be TED head, and there‚Äôs a reason she‚Äôs able to singlehandedly run a successful business. 
Inika is someone we hold to the highest regard. A more deserving Valedictorian could not have been chosen.

1/10/19, 8:12 PM - uv: ü§¨
1/10/19, 8:52 PM - uv: People think there‚Äôs one reality, but there‚Äôs loads of them, all snaking off, like roots. And what we do on one path affects what happens on the other paths. Time is a construct. People think you can‚Äôt go back and change things, but you can, that‚Äôs what flashbacks are, they‚Äôre invitations to go back and make different choices. When you make a decision, you think it‚Äôs you doing it, but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs the spirit out there that‚Äôs connected to our world that decides what we do and we just have to go along for the ride. Mirrors let you move through time. The government monitors people, they pay people to be your relatives and they put drugs in your food and they film you. There‚Äôs messages in every game. Like Pac-Man. Do you know what PAC stands for? P-A-C: ‚ÄúProgram and Control.‚Äù He‚Äôs Program and Control Man the whole thing's a metaphor, he thinks he‚Äôs got free will but really he‚Äôs trapped in a maze, in a system, all he can do is consume, he‚Äôs pursued by demons that are probably just in his own head, and even if he does manage to escape by slipping out one side of the maze, what happens? He comes right back in the other side. People think it‚Äôs a happy game, it‚Äôs not a happy game, it‚Äôs a fucking nightmare world and the worst thing is it‚Äôs real and we live in it. It‚Äôs all code. If you listen closely, you can hear the numbers. There‚Äôs a cosmic flowchart that dictates where you can and where you can‚Äôt go. I‚Äôve given you the knowledge. I‚Äôve set you free. Do you understand? I‚Äôll show you what I mean. Come with me. We‚Äôre on one path. Right now, me and you. And how one path ends is immaterial. It‚Äôs how our decisions along the path affect the whole that matters, do you believe me?

1/19/19, 11:11 PM - le nyom: My dear would it be to your liking if I request you to change the three words in your year book questionnaire? It's a life long treasure that you will love to relive for various reasons.
Also can you, Dhrithi and Sharanya look into the write-ups once. It definitely needs creative flavour. Some of the lines are quite repetitive, especially for a few girls.
I have proof-read  the 10th grade script, there is variety in their description.

Here‚Äôs to our friend being the architect of her own, personal Butterfly Effect- though we‚Äôre certain that Chaos will follow her wherever she goes.

1/29/19, 7:22 AM - le nyom: let's see
1/29/19, 7:22 AM - le nyom: I genuinely think he's being polite
1/29/19, 7:22 AM - le nyom: bc it's pat
1/29/19, 7:23 AM - uv: that's obviously not the case
1/29/19, 7:23 AM - uv: it's like you weren't even part of the conversation
1/29/19, 7:25 AM - le nyom: hhh uv
1/29/19, 7:25 AM - le nyom: pat is like that though
1/29/19, 7:25 AM - le nyom: idk we'll see I'm not gonna jump to conclusions
1/29/19, 7:25 AM - le nyom: I don't even remember us making out that day what if it was bad
1/29/19, 7:25 AM - le nyom: also yes I forgot to tell you
1/29/19, 7:25 AM - le nyom: I liked him before we made out
1/29/19, 7:26 AM - le nyom: maybe for like a month or so now
1/29/19, 7:27 AM - uv: that's a long time
1/29/19, 7:27 AM - uv: so much more than ‚Öõ
1/29/19, 7:49 AM - le nyom: shut up
1/29/19, 7:51 AM - uv: ok rude
1/29/19, 7:58 AM - le nyom: wow I hate myself and feelings
1/29/19, 8:01 AM - uv: he has feelings for you too stop being dramatic
1/29/19, 8:02 AM - le nyom: hshsjajajjajajajjajakakaiaiai
1/29/19, 11:55 AM - le nyom: Yeah it was alright I even found another one over there: female and tamale
1/29/19, 12:51 PM - le nyom: [1/29, 12:50 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: so we're 'taking it slow' and not rlly dating but basically dating
[1/29, 12:51 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: bc pat thinks long distance is trash so he doesn't wanna date date rn but we'll see when he's leaving types
[1/29, 12:51 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: w o w  guys I have feelings??? who am i
1/29/19, 12:51 PM - le nyom: and he's gonna tell adit, dhruvan and shah so don't tell them first

1/29/19, 3:09 PM - uv: is that Sumant
1/29/19, 3:16 PM - le nyom: yep
1/29/19, 3:17 PM - uv: classic koombl
1/29/19, 3:17 PM - uv: long distance is a bad idea
1/29/19, 3:17 PM - uv: even for Anjali and George, who have been going out for a year and a half and who are going to try long distance
1/29/19, 3:17 PM - uv: I don't think it'll work
1/29/19, 3:17 PM - uv: because it's indefinite
1/29/19, 3:18 PM - uv: it's not like you know that they'll be back in a year so you only need to do long distance for a year
1/29/19, 3:18 PM - le nyom: Yeah agreed 100%
1/29/19, 3:18 PM - uv: it's at least three or four years and even then no one knows where anyone will go
1/29/19, 3:18 PM - le nyom: but aren't they both going to delhi
1/29/19, 3:19 PM - uv: probably not
1/29/19, 3:19 PM - uv: Anjali's probably going to Azim Premji
1/29/19, 3:20 PM - uv: and George probably Ashoka but I think he's applying to a few places in Singapore as well
1/29/19, 3:20 PM - le nyom: Didn't she get into ashoka
1/29/19, 3:21 PM - uv: yep
1/29/19, 3:21 PM - uv: she did
1/29/19, 3:21 PM - le nyom: interesting
1/29/19, 3:21 PM - le nyom: no but if it's just india then they can probably work it out
1/29/19, 3:21 PM - uv: yeah she wants to stay close to her Family
1/29/19, 3:21 PM - uv: definitely easier
1/29/19, 3:21 PM - uv: but still tough
1/29/19, 3:21 PM - le nyom: like the people in flame, ashoka and op Jindal come at least once in two months
1/29/19, 3:21 PM - le nyom: true
1/29/19, 3:23 PM - uv: oh really
1/29/19, 3:23 PM - uv: then maybe they can
1/29/19, 3:23 PM - le nyom: Yeah like shaurya and all are here almost every weekend
1/29/19, 3:23 PM - le nyom: but that's overdoing it
1/29/19, 3:23 PM - uv: who is that
1/29/19, 3:25 PM - le nyom: he was in niketan
1/29/19, 3:27 PM - uv: no clue

1/29/19, 3:28 PM - uv: but he's going abroad
1/29/19, 3:28 PM - uv: so if you want a relationship you both have to go into it thinking it's gonna end in a few months
1/29/19, 3:28 PM - uv: ya
1/29/19, 3:28 PM - le nyom: yeah
1/29/19, 3:29 PM - le nyom: one step at a time or something I guess
1/29/19, 3:29 PM - uv: but limit the steps as well
1/29/19, 3:29 PM - uv: don't take too many

1/29/19, 9:06 PM - le nyom: yeah exactly
1/29/19, 9:06 PM - uv: but I don't think that means that he doesn't like you or that he just said it to avoid awkward conversations
1/29/19, 9:06 PM - uv: maybe he realised he liked you after you said it
1/29/19, 9:06 PM - le nyom: yeah possible
1/29/19, 9:29 PM - uv: yeah
1/29/19, 9:29 PM - uv: I really don't think it's this

1/30/19, 6:15 PM - le nyom: I know, exactly
1/30/19, 6:15 PM - uv: she couldn't really tell you after you'd told her that you liked each other
1/30/19, 6:15 PM - uv: what else was there

1/30/19, 6:49 PM - uv: as if you've stolen the love of her life five minutes before she was about to get married
1/30/19, 6:49 PM - uv: so overkill

1/30/19, 6:50 PM - le nyom: those are the only two chats I opened I promise!!
1/30/19, 6:50 PM - le nyom: I just wanted to check if she told amira specifically about pat and I bc then hershey would find out and I don't wanna deal w him also at this point in time
1/30/19, 6:51 PM - uv: since when does she talk to Amira wat
1/30/19, 6:51 PM - uv: how is this an all time low
1/30/19, 6:51 PM - le nyom: however shah did text 'pat and Sam' on the tuition group that hershey is also on
1/30/19, 6:51 PM - uv: why is she being so dramatic
1/30/19, 6:51 PM - le nyom: you would think the time you rejected her was the low point
1/30/19, 6:52 PM - uv: you'd think that liking me would be the low point
1/30/19, 6:52 PM - uv: but I never rejected her
1/30/19, 6:52 PM - uv: I just didn't know
1/30/19, 6:52 PM - le nyom: oh rip

[1/30, 6:30 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: I can't believe I didn't see it man
[1/30, 6:30 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: She likes him no??
[1/30, 6:30 PM] Nehü§ë: huh
[1/30, 6:30 PM] Nehü§ë: what did she say
[1/30, 6:30 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: idk how I didn't spot it before
[1/30, 6:30 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: nothing she was just being so transparent
[1/30, 6:30 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: I feel so so so shit
[1/30, 6:31 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: I'll back off from pat bro vij over pat anyday I feel so bad
[1/30, 6:31 PM] Nehü§ë: see sam like i told her as well noones wrong here bc noone fkn knew what the other person was feeling 
you didn't tell her about pat before and neither did she  
you just made a move and she didn't and she can't be 'mad' at u but she can be hurt by the situation
[1/30, 6:31 PM] Nehü§ë: don't
[1/30, 6:31 PM] Nehü§ë: like i luv her but if you're happy in this you don't owe it to anyone to break anything off
[1/30, 6:32 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: are you sure??
[1/30, 6:32 PM] Nehü§ë: ya dude
[1/30, 6:32 PM] Nehü§ë: it's not your fault at all
[1/30, 6:32 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: I have like 5 friends I can't afford to lose any
[1/30, 6:33 PM] Nehü§ë: doesn't mean you push away something that makes you happy bc you're scared
[1/30, 6:33 PM] Nehü§ë: the people who luv u will stay with you
[1/30, 6:33 PM] Nehü§ë: boys come and go and friends who know that won't let it get in bw
[1/30, 6:33 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: also it's a little scary but pat just told me he liked tia until very very recently and he only thought about me after I told him
[1/30, 6:33 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: so ya happy fun times
[1/30, 6:33 PM] Nehü§ë: okay that's scary ngl
[1/30, 6:34 PM] Nehü§ë: but i kinda saw that
[1/30, 6:34 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: ya pat and tee would've been so cute
[1/30, 6:34 PM] Nehü§ë: that's rlly weird  don't say thatüòÇ
[1/30, 6:34 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: but I told him it's okay we're not dating, we're just seeing if there's something here
[1/30, 6:34 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: so idk
[1/30, 6:34 PM] Nehü§ë: ya makes sense
[1/30, 6:35 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: I still feel weird about it but I'll shut up
[1/30, 6:35 PM] Nehü§ë: about tia thing or vij?
[1/30, 6:35 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: boTh
[1/30, 6:35 PM] Nehü§ë: Tia thing ya okay i get it and I think the fact that you're taking it slow makes sense now ,like even more than before
[1/30, 6:36 PM] Nehü§ë: about the vij thing , dude Sam you aren't wrong like if this is what you want you should make it work I don't think you should like prioritize one over the other types
[1/30, 6:37 PM] Nehü§ë: dude ugh sam i hate saying this but both of yall individually and pat would have to take things slow, if it was her doing this then it'd be the same 
it's not like if vij was w him it'd be a perfect relationship??? so you didn't get in bw anything
[1/30, 6:38 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: Yeah
[1/30, 6:38 PM] Nehü§ë: i luv both of yall and Sam you know i have your back but I'll state facts and what to me is right or wrong 
the fact that I'm saying all this is not bc i don't like vij or wtv it's bc it's facts and i don't see anything wrong
[1/30, 6:38 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: I guess
[1/30, 6:38 PM] Nehü§ë: if you knew about vijs feelings then it'd be wrong but u didn't
[1/30, 6:39 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: yeah but I just feel shit for not being able to see it earlier
[1/30, 6:40 PM] Nehü§ë: that's why when vij told me yesterday I said bro you should've said something ,even to me atleast I couldve told sam or smthn but now that it's happened you can make either of the decisions either tell Sam how u feel and propose a POA or keep it in forever bc you can't just bring it up when things get serious
[1/30, 6:40 PM] Nehü§ë: that isn't your fault
[1/30, 6:40 PM] Nehü§ë: noone saw it
[1/30, 6:40 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: yeah
[1/30, 6:40 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: ugh
[1/30, 6:40 PM] Nehü§ë: Sam you aren't wrong
[1/30, 6:40 PM] Nehü§ë: I'll tell you that much
[1/30, 6:40 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: I hope this all just becomes less of a mess later
[1/30, 6:41 PM] Nehü§ë: it will dw
[1/30, 6:41 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: The only reason I didn't tell anyone about pat was because last time I had feelings was the debAcle that was hershey
[1/30, 6:41 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: And I never even intended to tell him idk what the fuck I was thinking
[1/30, 6:41 PM] Nehü§ë: idk what that word means brb dictionary.com
[1/30, 6:41 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: but I guess I'm glad it happened
[1/30, 6:41 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: HAHAHAHH
[1/30, 6:42 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: catastrophe??
[1/30, 6:42 PM] Nehü§ë: ya got you
[1/30, 6:42 PM] Nehü§ë: thank you
[1/30, 6:42 PM] Nehü§ë: dude don't regret that
[1/30, 6:42 PM] Nehü§ë: you and Hershey were a g thing
[1/30, 6:42 PM] Nehü§ë: you learnt sm from it
[1/30, 6:42 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: yeah but it was the last time I was actually vulnerable w someone and it turned out so bad
[1/30, 6:42 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: so im scared
[1/30, 6:43 PM] Nehü§ë: see sam that's how having feelings for someone works 
and sometimes it's the beauty of it
[1/30, 6:44 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: yeah
[1/30, 6:44 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: sigh
[1/30, 6:48 PM] Nehü§ë: dw okay

2/4/19, 11:34 PM - le nyom: idk I'm probably overcomplicating it

[16/02, 10:41 pm] uv: in that case I would recommend a vibrator instead
[16/02, 10:41 pm] uv: doesn't seem like the sea cucumber would have a great time
[16/02, 10:42 pm] Roshni Prasad: but I'm getting into the organic trend now
[16/02, 10:43 pm] Roshni Prasad: well the wriggling around would just make it even more confusing
[16/02, 10:44 pm] uv: you present a challenge
[16/02, 10:44 pm] uv: how about hiring someone to sing at your vagina's natural frequency

3/7/19, 10:31 PM - uv: remember these messages
3/7/19, 10:31 PM - uv: keep these in mind
3/7/19, 10:41 PM - le nyom: okay why
3/7/19, 10:41 PM - uv: so I asked Riddhi to see if she could find out anything about the Shreya situation
3/7/19, 10:41 PM - uv: since I'm catching feelings again and they're pretty close friends
3/7/19, 10:42 PM - uv: so she asked today and found out that
3/7/19, 10:42 PM - uv: Shreya was very sure that after kitty ko she would fall for me hard again
3/7/19, 10:42 PM - uv: Shreya's words
3/7/19, 10:43 PM - uv: but then these messages were sent
3/7/19, 10:43 PM - uv: by Nikhil and Manya
3/7/19, 10:43 PM - uv: not by me
3/7/19, 10:43 PM - uv: and for some time she thought it was me sending those messages and was very disturbed
3/7/19, 10:43 PM - uv: which is why she's been pulling away slightly since then
3/7/19, 10:43 PM - uv: but she knows it wasn't me and feels guilty about blaming me for it
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - uv: but is finding it difficult to separate those messages from me
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - le nyom: oh my god what
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - uv: so she doesn't know how she feels now or something like that
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - le nyom: I can't believe she's taking this so seriously
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - uv: and I'm just
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - uv: so annoyed
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - uv: this isn't even my fault
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - uv: I didn't even send those messages
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - le nyom: EXACTLY
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - le nyom: I'll fight nikhil and manya
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - uv: did you see those as if I would ever say anything like that
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - uv: I'm so upset honestly
3/7/19, 10:44 PM - le nyom: EXACTLYYYY
3/7/19, 10:45 PM - le nyom: It's like she doesn't even know you
3/7/19, 10:45 PM - uv: apparently I was someone she was close to and trusted a lot so when she thought even for some time that those messages were from me she was very disturbed
3/7/19, 10:45 PM - uv: this is so unfair I didn't even send those messages
3/7/19, 10:49 PM - le nyom: God I'm so annoyed

3/8/19, 8:46 AM - uv: if this persists it could give you an out from the relationship, should you want to take it
3/8/19, 8:46 AM - le nyom: yeah

3/8/19, 9:04 AM - uv: yes
3/8/19, 9:04 AM - uv: go go go
3/8/19, 9:05 AM - uv: [08/03, 8:47 am] Anjali Kapadia: Not to sound too negative but if a bunch of messages that weren't even sent by you can hinder the way she feels
[08/03, 8:48 am] Anjali Kapadia: Maybe her feelings for you aren't that strong
[08/03, 8:49 am] Anjali Kapadia: Also about her being disturbed and being unable to separate those messages from you is a bit dumb
[08/03, 8:49 am] Anjali Kapadia: They weren't even sent by you!!!
[08/03, 8:49 am] Anjali Kapadia: She knows that!!
[08/03, 8:49 am] uv: believe me I know that
[08/03, 8:49 am] uv: this is just
[08/03, 8:49 am] uv: so annoying
[08/03, 8:49 am] Anjali Kapadia: I don't know why this is an obstacle for her
[08/03, 8:50 am] Anjali Kapadia: They're just a bunch of messages
[08/03, 8:51 am] Anjali Kapadia: Honestly oovs if something so small can can change the way she feels...
[08/03, 8:52 am] uv: the thing is I get why she would be disturbed when those messages were sent
[08/03, 8:52 am] uv: because they were weird and creepy and totally unlike me
[08/03, 8:52 am] Anjali Kapadia: She just seems really volatile and I feel like falling for someone like that even if they like you back is not a good idea
[08/03, 8:53 am] uv: but I don't know why she's been unable to separate those messages from me
[08/03, 8:53 am] uv: is this keeping aside your natural hatred for her
[08/03, 8:54 am] Anjali Kapadia: Yess... She's so confusing and you know it! I think she's having a hard time making up her mind about you
[08/03, 8:55 am] Anjali Kapadia: I think she's just using these messages to create a bit of drama but also to give her some time to think
[08/03, 8:57 am] Anjali Kapadia: Maybe she can't separate them from you cause she knows you still like her and even if those messages weren't from you, in that moment when she read them they were like a confirmation
[08/03, 8:58 am] Anjali Kapadia: But honestly once you know the messages weren't coming from you it's not that hard to separate them from a person üòí
[08/03, 8:58 am] uv: how would she know though
[08/03, 8:59 am] uv: besides the thing at kitty ko
[08/03, 8:59 am] uv: which is good enough I suppose
[08/03, 9:01 am] Anjali Kapadia: You guys flirt all the time. You don't do that with anyone else and she knows that. Everyone can see it if they observe you guys so I'm pretty sure she'd know
[08/03, 9:04 am] uv: ah that way
[08/03, 9:04 am] uv: well
[08/03, 9:04 am] uv: so much for that
3/8/19, 9:07 AM - le nyom: yes she makes a vEry good point
3/8/19, 9:07 AM - le nyom: I don't know shreya at all but honestly it seems like an
3/8/19, 9:08 AM - le nyom: easy out as you said
3/8/19, 9:09 AM - uv: yes but
3/8/19, 9:09 AM - uv: I don't really want an out remember
3/8/19, 9:13 AM - le nyom: no for her
3/8/19, 9:13 AM - le nyom: she's using this as an excuse to not address her feelings and stuff
3/8/19, 9:13 AM - uv: oh that way
3/8/19, 9:13 AM - uv: it's really annoying that what Anjali's saying makes sense
3/8/19, 9:15 AM - le nyom: yeah it's like every single time you make a point
3/8/19, 9:15 AM - le nyom: makes me want to die
3/8/19, 9:15 AM - uv: ok that's rude

"Hey Penny"

knock knock knock

"Hey Penny"

knock knock knock

"Hey Penny"

knock knock knock

"Hey Penny"

knock knock knock

"Hey Penny"

knock knock knock

"Hey Penny"

knock knock knock

"Hey Penny"

This was it. The point of no return. Penny sits by the door, waiting for Sheldon's ceaseless annoyance to end.

knock knock knock

"Hey Penny"

But she knows at the deepest depths of her now cold and dead heart, that it will never end. Penny cocks her gun. She no longer needs to ready herself, as she knows she will feel no remorse about what's to come.

knock knock knock

"Hey Penny"

BLAM

Silence. Complete and total silence. This is what Penny wanted, so why does she still feel empty inside? Sheldon cannot speak anymore. There will be no more "Hey Penny", there will be no more knocking at the door. But she still feels dead. Life is purposeless. Ever since the voices came, nothing was the same. Leonard killed himself. Howard's in death row for a mass shooting at a television store, reportedly driven insane by the sitcoms playing out front. Amy and Bernadette both put themselves into a suicide pact, throwing themselves and eachother off of a building in eachother's arms. Raj will spend a lifetime in jail for what he did to those poor children who dared to repeat Sheldon's catchphrase. When questioned, he said that "They already were long gone if they'd use such infernal language. Their souls were rotting in hell long before."

Everyone else had heard the voices. Not Penny. She didn't hear the laughter whenever Sheldon gave his usual remark, or when she incorrectly stated the name of a popular video game. Not before, anyways. now she hears from beyond the door, Sheldon's last breaths - "Bazinga." Penny begins to hear laughter as it dawns on her. Everything makes so much sense - Kripke! Howard's mother! The children! It all pieced together so perfectly within Penny's mind. Now, it all makes sense. Penny decided that, because of it, she needed to go. Her life is over. She murdered Sheldon, she would be thrown in jail. She would hear the laughter for the rest of her sorry life. She puts the gun to her head. She is completely comfortable with what will happen next, as her finger presses against the trigger. She begins to mouth her last word, as it will be the most important thing she's ever said.

"Zimbabwe."

4/3/19, 12:06 AM - le nyom: the interest I got this month was 57 rupees what's even the point
4/3/19, 12:07 AM - le nyom: I might as well just keep all my money in cash
4/3/19, 12:08 AM - uv: so after a year you'll get 674
4/3/19, 12:08 AM - uv: more actually if it compounds monthly
4/3/19, 12:09 AM - le nyom: nac doesn't compound
4/3/19, 12:09 AM - le nyom: that's assuming I always have this much money in my account

4/3/19, 12:11 AM - uv: that doesn't make sense
4/3/19, 12:15 AM - le nyom: I'm pretty sure it's simple interest for savings accounts and compound when you take a loan
4/3/19, 12:16 AM - uv: oh weird
4/3/19, 12:17 AM - uv: anyway if you've got 57 for this month and it's simple you'll get 12 times that after the year

4/9/19, 7:42 PM - uv: ya I was thinking we'll meet or at least talk about it after she gets her marks because
4/9/19, 7:43 PM - uv: there's something else I've been thinking as well
4/9/19, 7:43 PM - uv: someone told me what she got in physics and
4/9/19, 7:43 PM - uv: it isn't great
4/9/19, 7:43 PM - uv: and at the grad party she was talking about how her grades are really important because her offer is conditional and how her parents wanted her to do well in the preboards
4/9/19, 7:43 PM - uv: so I don't want to get into a relationship with her if it means that she'd be distracted from her studies
4/9/19, 7:43 PM - le nyom: she's clearly distracted even without the relationship if her grades are already bad so
4/9/19, 7:44 PM - uv: that's a very good point you make there
4/9/19, 7:44 PM - uv: in short I basically just need to talk to her and flesh it out
4/9/19, 8:18 PM - le nyom: yeah exactly

4/13/19, 4:13 PM - uv: me too
4/13/19, 4:26 PM - le nyom: no
4/13/19, 4:30 PM - uv: When I was pretty young, maybe like 8, 9, 10, something like that, I was too young to be able to ejaculate but old enough to get a "funny feeling" in my penis and want to play around with it to no result sometimes.

One night I wandered out of my room and my parents were watching something in the living room. It was in black and white and there seemed to be a bunch of naked people walking around and then the naked people were in a big pile. At this point my parents realized I was there and yelled at me to go back to my room and what was on TV wasn't for kids.

I thought it was some kind of porn, it wasn't the first time I've caught them watching something like Cinemax or something I wasn't supposed to see. That image popped up a lot in my early fruitless wiener rubbing sessions. Naked people in a big pile, yeah.

Many years later I saw the footage and recognized it as parts of it had been burned into my younger mind. Unfortunately it was part of a holocaust documentary and the naked people had been killed and put into a big naked pile to be dumped into a mass grave.

Basically, I fapped to corpses of holocaust victims.

4/16/19, 8:34 PM - le nyom: why
4/16/19, 8:41 PM - uv: because all my girl friends' parents want to spend time with them
4/16/19, 8:41 PM - uv: without me
4/16/19, 8:41 PM - uv: Kavya's parents called them a while ago
4/16/19, 8:41 PM - le nyom: what
4/16/19, 8:41 PM - le nyom: oh
4/16/19, 8:41 PM - uv: they've gone to Alaina's house today

4/16/19, 8:42 PM - le nyom: useless piece of information but yeah
4/16/19, 8:42 PM - uv: Anjali's parent sought them out at grad and said hey we should get to know each other better
4/16/19, 8:42 PM - uv: and your mom is now part of that monthly rbs reunion squad
4/16/19, 8:42 PM - uv: hence my life is in crisis

4/16/19, 8:45 PM - uv: no
4/16/19, 8:46 PM - uv: Crisis
4/16/19, 8:46 PM - uv: see are eye ess eye ess
4/16/19, 8:46 PM - uv: you're a refried bean
4/16/19, 8:47 PM - le nyom: ok thank you
4/16/19, 8:49 PM - uv: no worz
4/16/19, 8:49 PM - uv: if you defry a refried bean does it become just a fried bean
4/16/19, 8:49 PM - le nyom: how do you defry
4/16/19, 8:49 PM - uv: or do you not know how many times it was fried in the first place
4/16/19, 8:50 PM - uv: so it could still be a refried bean
4/16/19, 8:50 PM - uv: chemistry
4/16/19, 8:50 PM - le nyom: yes!!
4/16/19, 8:50 PM - le nyom: but refried seems like it's fried only twice
4/16/19, 8:51 PM - uv: so you're saying that if it was fried thrice it'd be called a rerefried bean
4/16/19, 8:51 PM - uv: and four times a rererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:51 PM - uv: five times a rerererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:51 PM - uv: and six times a rererererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:51 PM - uv: and seven times a rerererererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:52 PM - uv: and eight times a rererererererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:52 PM - uv: and nine times a rerererererererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:52 PM - uv: and ten times a rererererererererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:52 PM - uv: and eleven times a rerererererererererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:52 PM - uv: and twelve times a rererererererererererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:52 PM - uv: and thirteen times a rerererererererererererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:53 PM - uv: and fourteen times a rererererererererererererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:53 PM - uv: and fifteen times a rerererererererererererererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:53 PM - uv: and sixteen times a rererererererererererererererefried bean
4/16/19, 8:53 PM - le nyom: I hate you bye
4/16/19, 8:53 PM - uv: so no?
4/16/19, 8:54 PM - le nyom: yes
4/16/19, 8:54 PM - uv: so refried remains refried even after being defried
4/16/19, 8:55 PM - uv: because of the infinite number of times it could have been fried
4/16/19, 8:55 PM - le nyom: precisely
4/16/19, 8:56 PM - uv: so fried beans only exist the moment after the beans are fried for the first time
4/16/19, 8:57 PM - uv: subsequent frying (henceforth called refrying) renders them permanently refried due to the potentially uncountable nature of the number of times it could have been fried
4/16/19, 8:57 PM - uv: I think we have enough for a thesis here
4/16/19, 8:57 PM - uv: Brown here I come

4/24/19, 2:32 PM - uv: Ball cleveage shorts should be a thing.

I feel like society is ready.

I can imagine all sorts of cool outfits that show off my ball cleveage, for the office, for the pool, weddings and any sort of occasion.

Wearing ball cleavage shorts will allow us men to use our assets to flirt with women who are in power in hopes of gaining some unfair advantage over those who are less endowed.

There would be "wonder shorts" which push the balls up front and accentuate the cleavage. Like diamonds on a pedestal.

There would be a little hole in the shorts to let the ball cleavage poke through
4/24/19, 2:34 PM - le nyom: bye
4/24/19, 2:37 PM - uv: Ok, fewwas, heaw me out.

Fiwst things fiwst, the dude is puwpwe. What kind of hetewosexuaw man is puwpwe. Onwy women and homosexuaws awe puwpwe, it is a giwwy cowow not fow hetewosexuaw men. But if that wasn't enough, think about thanos as a chawactew. He had to sacwifice a hot piece of ass named Gamowa to get the souw stone. Any HETEWOSEXUAW man wouwdve chosen the woman ovew the souw stone, thewefowe he is a homosexuaw. IF EVEN THAT IS NOT ENOUGH, thewe is mowe. wook at the infinite gauntwet, which is basicawwy a fist, which he used to dewete peopwe wike spidewman. He basicawwy FISTED othew MEN, thats suuuuuuuuupew homosexuaw bwo, wike wegit stwaight up deadass homosexuaw. IN ADDITION, thanos is going awound the gawaxy to cowwect shiny wocks, thats pwetty fucking homosexuaw bwoski, wike thats a woman thing, not a guy thing (unwess you awe a homosexuaw guy). So when wooking at the fact that thanos is puwpwe, chose a shiny wock ovew a sexy woman, he weguwawwy fists othew men, and that he twavews awound the univewse to find mowe of these wetawded shiny wocks, i cant come to any othew concwusion than Thanos being a homosexuaw.

4/29/19, 12:47 PM - uv: the amount of effort that goes into starting a series which requires so much investment

4/29/19, 1:25 PM - uv: also

4/29/19, 7:11 PM - uv: also
4/29/19, 7:34 PM - le nyom: yes?
4/29/19, 7:38 PM - uv: the second also was to buy me time because I forgot what the first one was about
4/29/19, 7:38 PM - uv: oh right I spoke to Shreya
4/29/19, 7:40 PM - le nyom: oh lovely
4/29/19, 7:40 PM - le nyom: about what
4/29/19, 7:42 PM - uv: didn't I tell you that we were supposed to speak about us when she got back from holiday
4/29/19, 7:42 PM - le nyom: oh yeAh
4/29/19, 7:42 PM - le nyom: and?
4/29/19, 7:55 PM - uv: so this was a while ago actually
4/29/19, 7:55 PM - uv: but she'd asked me not to talk about it to anyone
4/29/19, 7:55 PM - uv: until we have more
4/29/19, 7:55 PM - uv: clarity
4/29/19, 7:56 PM - uv: but apparently we're going for a 50% relationship sort of thing with no obligations and some boundaries but we don't know what they are
4/29/19, 7:56 PM - uv: and 50% not 100 because college is right around the corner
4/29/19, 7:57 PM - le nyom: what does no obligations mean
4/29/19, 7:59 PM - uv: the don't know what they are applies to that too
4/29/19, 8:00 PM - uv: but I think it's like we won't be calling each other boyfriend/girlfriend
4/29/19, 8:00 PM - uv: along with other stuff but neither of us knows what other stuff is
4/29/19, 8:00 PM - uv: we're just seeing how it goes really
4/29/19, 8:02 PM - le nyom: this sounds like a hershey and me situation
4/29/19, 8:02 PM - uv: well you guys were in love
4/29/19, 8:03 PM - uv: also I find it difficult to believe that you love Rishanth
4/29/19, 8:03 PM - le nyom: in the end yeah
4/29/19, 8:03 PM - le nyom: same
4/29/19, 8:03 PM - le nyom: it's not as much as hershey I will say that
4/29/19, 8:03 PM - uv: since just before Goa you were saying oh I want to break up etc etc
4/29/19, 8:03 PM - uv: makes sense
4/29/19, 8:03 PM - uv: there was a lot more time there
4/29/19, 8:03 PM - le nyom: yeah I know but it genuinely did get a lot better in goa
4/29/19, 8:03 PM - le nyom: truw
4/29/19, 8:04 PM - uv: that's good then
4/29/19, 8:04 PM - uv: oh and also
4/29/19, 8:04 PM - le nyom: but ya I think to avoid hershey and me style confusion you should talk about exactly what y'all are
4/29/19, 8:05 PM - uv: I wasn't pushing too hard for this because I knew that Shreya would be in Bangalore (and other friends obviously) (but partially mainly her)
4/29/19, 8:05 PM - uv: and then she said she's doing to Goa ü§™ü§™
4/29/19, 8:05 PM - uv: what sort of confusion
4/29/19, 8:05 PM - le nyom: rip
4/29/19, 8:05 PM - le nyom: like
4/29/19, 8:05 PM - le nyom: feelings
4/29/19, 8:06 PM - uv: we have those yes
4/29/19, 8:06 PM - uv: agreed
4/29/19, 8:06 PM - uv: so now I'm stuck here not going to Goa and not going to Kathmandu
4/29/19, 8:07 PM - le nyom: who's going to Kathmandu
4/29/19, 8:07 PM - uv: nobody now
4/29/19, 8:08 PM - uv: I'd mentioned to Riddhi and some others that my aunt and uncle live there and they said uv bring friends and come along
4/29/19, 8:08 PM - uv: and Riddhi said oh yes I'd much rather go to Kathmandu than Goa
4/29/19, 8:08 PM - uv: and then flaked
4/29/19, 8:08 PM - uv: so if you want to go to Kathmandu and can find some other people then by all means
4/29/19, 8:09 PM - le nyom: oh dark side of the momo aunt
4/29/19, 8:09 PM - le nyom: the only friend we both have is inika

5/4/19, 9:50 PM - uv: yeah when I heard it with the rest of the album a while ago I didn't really think much of it but now I'm listening to the album once again and this is currently just playing on repeat
5/4/19, 9:53 PM - le nyom: I haven't heard the whole album yet
5/4/19, 9:54 PM - uv: oh lame
5/4/19, 9:54 PM - uv: I didn't think it was great the first time I heard it though
5/4/19, 9:55 PM - le nyom: hm yeah understandable

5/4/19, 10:14 PM - uv: The diagram shows the graph of the probability density function, f, of a random variable X which

takes values between 0 and a only. It is given that P(X < 1) = 0.25.
5/4/19, 10:18 PM - le nyom: ok

5/4/19, 11:32 PM - le nyom: no idea but I got this
5/4/19, 11:32 PM - le nyom: <Media omitted>
5/4/19, 11:33 PM - uv: why didn't she just text you directly
5/4/19, 11:33 PM - uv: or is that messenger
5/4/19, 11:33 PM - le nyom: messenger I'm assuming
5/4/19, 11:33 PM - uv: I love Rithish's responses
5/4/19, 11:33 PM - uv: wow imagine spending 75k on a phone that breaks ü§©ü§©
5/4/19, 11:33 PM - le nyom: me too he's so confused
5/4/19, 11:33 PM - le nyom: I KNOW HAHAHAHAHA
5/4/19, 11:34 PM - le nyom: that's literally what I told Neha she's so fkn dumb
5/4/19, 11:34 PM - uv: what did you tell her
5/4/19, 11:34 PM - le nyom: she got a XR
5/4/19, 11:35 PM - le nyom: and basically she's just so used to having a oneplus and the battery life and how it will literally never break
5/4/19, 11:35 PM - le nyom: ya bad decision
5/4/19, 11:40 PM - uv: where's she off to for college
5/4/19, 11:40 PM - le nyom: flame or manipal most probably
5/4/19, 11:40 PM - le nyom: she said her flame interview went rlly well so she's hoping she gets that
5/4/19, 11:41 PM - uv: and here you were hoping to be rid of her after school
5/4/19, 11:42 PM - le nyom: yeah but she's doing mass communication in manipal and you need to do the entrance test for that
5/4/19, 11:42 PM - le nyom: and she didn't do rlly well so she might not get in
5/4/19, 11:43 PM - uv: is mass communication the default major for people who don't know what they want to do with their life
5/4/19, 11:44 PM - le nyom: she actually has a veRy specific plan, they just don't offer it in manipal
5/4/19, 11:44 PM - le nyom: that's why she wants to go to flame
5/4/19, 11:45 PM - uv: oh
5/4/19, 11:46 PM - le nyom: yep
5/5/19, 12:44 AM - uv: what's her plan
5/5/19, 1:23 AM - le nyom: she wants to study public policy and stuff but like
5/5/19, 1:23 AM - le nyom: eventually she wants to end up working in the private sector
5/5/19, 1:24 AM - le nyom: like either a think tank types or like
5/5/19, 1:24 AM - le nyom: Instagram and twitter have policy analysts and stuff
5/5/19, 9:03 AM - uv: oh

5/6/19, 5:56 PM - le nyom: why doesn't she have an Indian accent
5/6/19, 5:56 PM - uv: I mean she doesn't really have an accent
5/6/19, 5:57 PM - uv: like I don't have much of an accent or Camran or Anjali
5/6/19, 5:58 PM - le nyom: you're thinking of like
5/6/19, 5:58 PM - le nyom: apu from the simpsons
5/6/19, 5:59 PM - uv: I assume he has a thick Indian accent because I've never watched the simpsons
5/6/19, 5:59 PM - le nyom: which is not an accurate representation of an Indian accent
5/6/19, 5:59 PM - le nyom: yes he does
5/6/19, 5:59 PM - le nyom: all of us
5/6/19, 5:59 PM - le nyom: have indian accents
5/6/19, 6:00 PM - uv: nah I disagree
5/6/19, 6:00 PM - le nyom: ok but you're wrong
5/6/19, 6:03 PM - uv: nah I disagree
5/6/19, 6:04 PM - le nyom: you're
5/6/19, 6:04 PM - le nyom: wrong
5/6/19, 6:04 PM - le nyom: like there's a buzzfeed vid w American Indians talking about Indian accents on tv
5/6/19, 6:05 PM - le nyom: and krish's brother is in if
5/6/19, 6:05 PM - le nyom: it
5/6/19, 6:05 PM - le nyom: and his accent is exactly like how most of ours are
5/6/19, 6:05 PM - le nyom: and the entire comment section is just
5/6/19, 6:05 PM - le nyom: wow shiv's accent üòçüòç
5/6/19, 6:10 PM - uv: I think his accent is a bit more pronounced than some of ours actually
5/6/19, 6:11 PM - le nyom: you can't not have an accent uv
5/6/19, 6:11 PM - le nyom: it's like an American saying they don't have an accent??
5/6/19, 6:11 PM - le nyom: they do
5/6/19, 6:12 PM - uv: nope I still disagree
5/6/19, 6:13 PM - uv: anyway
5/6/19, 6:13 PM - uv: even if I'm wrong
5/6/19, 6:13 PM - uv: which I disagree with
5/6/19, 6:13 PM - uv: where did I
5/6/19, 6:13 PM - uv: say any of that
5/6/19, 6:14 PM - le nyom: I mean I guess she was just expecting a little
5/6/19, 6:14 PM - le nyom: more than just
5/6/19, 6:15 PM - le nyom: you don't have this, you don't have that
5/6/19, 6:15 PM - le nyom: like your initial reaction was not the most
5/6/19, 6:15 PM - le nyom: happy/supportive
5/6/19, 6:15 PM - uv: [06/05, 5:04 pm] uv: oh that's
[06/05, 5:04 pm] uv: awesome
[06/05, 5:07 pm] uv: cool stuff
5/6/19, 6:15 PM - uv: this was my initial reaction
5/6/19, 6:16 PM - le nyom: ok do you want me to say you're right & she's wrong
5/6/19, 6:16 PM - uv: no I'm just arguing my point of view
5/6/19, 6:17 PM - uv: if I agreed with her I wouldn't be saying anything here
5/6/19, 6:17 PM - le nyom: I mean to be fair you do that to me a lot as well
5/6/19, 6:17 PM - le nyom: pointing out le flaws as soon as I tell you something I'm excited about
5/6/19, 6:17 PM - le nyom: which is fine bc im used to you being you but I guess she's just not
5/6/19, 6:18 PM - uv: like what
5/6/19, 6:18 PM - uv: I'm not saying I haven't done that I just can't remember a specific instance
5/6/19, 6:18 PM - le nyom: I can't remember specific instances either
5/6/19, 6:19 PM - le nyom: but something along those lines was like when you asked what  Neha's plan was and I told you, the gist of what you said was eh she probably won't get it so don't get her hopes up
5/6/19, 6:19 PM - uv: no my meaning there wasn't that she won't get it
5/6/19, 6:20 PM - uv: it was that stuff happens in life and so her plan might change
5/6/19, 6:20 PM - le nyom: like maybe that's not what you meant but that is how it came across
5/6/19, 6:20 PM - uv: or stuff happens that may prevent her plan from happening
5/6/19, 6:20 PM - le nyom: and that's how a lot of what you say comes across
5/6/19, 6:21 PM - le nyom: I know but like?? obviously she's thought things through, like after two years, you're not the only person to offer this new fresh exciting perspective ygm?
5/6/19, 6:22 PM - le nyom: what im trying to say is
5/6/19, 6:22 PM - le nyom: im pretty sure nobody just does something thinking oh it will definitely 400% work out
5/6/19, 6:23 PM - uv: no of course not
5/6/19, 6:23 PM - le nyom: and when you say things like that it comes across as you acting a lil superior and like you know best
5/6/19, 6:23 PM - uv: but a similar situation was when I was applying to ivy type places it was in hope rather than any form of expectation
5/6/19, 6:23 PM - uv: and one of those worked out and I got lucky there
5/6/19, 6:24 PM - uv: but you know like two days before ivy day I said something about how I maybe should've applied to more middle places and not so many top places because I didn't think I would get in
5/6/19, 6:24 PM - uv: that's just the way I look at things
5/6/19, 6:24 PM - uv: I look at things from the perspective that oh x things could go wrong other people are better suited etc etc
5/6/19, 6:25 PM - le nyom: yes and that's fine to be realistic but a loT of the time your realism is mostly just pessimism, like people have already looked at what could go wrong and all they want from their friend is a little support and encouragement
5/6/19, 6:31 PM - uv: lovely
5/6/19, 6:31 PM - uv: maybe I'll work on that then
5/6/19, 6:33 PM - le nyom: maybe
5/6/19, 6:33 PM - le nyom: have you heard kunal nayyar talk
5/6/19, 6:33 PM - le nyom: the guy that plays raj on big bang theory

5/6/19, 6:42 PM - le nyom: he talks like
5/6/19, 6:42 PM - le nyom: most of us
5/6/19, 6:42 PM - le nyom: and he has
5/6/19, 6:42 PM - le nyom: an accent
5/6/19, 6:42 PM - uv: to me that sounded more pronounced than the voices that are normally around me
5/6/19, 6:43 PM - le nyom: I think that's because he was with a bunch of people that had american accents
5/6/19, 6:44 PM - uv: maybe
5/6/19, 6:45 PM - uv: anyway maybe she had her reasons but I still think her reaction was a bit over the top
5/6/19, 6:46 PM - le nyom: yeah I guess
5/6/19, 6:46 PM - le nyom: boi bye was my favourite part
5/6/19, 6:46 PM - uv: oh good you have a favourite part

5/7/19, 6:54 PM - uv: but my guess is that's my own fault
5/7/19, 6:54 PM - uv: also if possible when getting a phone try to get one which is part of the android one program
5/7/19, 6:58 PM - le nyom: what is that
5/7/19, 7:03 PM - uv: phones that are part of that program get guaranteed android updates for two years and security updates for three years
5/7/19, 7:06 PM - le nyom: oh lovely
5/7/19, 7:06 PM - le nyom: I think oneplus runs oxygen os or something

5/7/19, 7:08 PM - uv: yeah but that's based on Android
5/7/19, 7:08 PM - uv: so it probably wouldn't be a part of android one

5/11/19, 12:53 PM - le nyom: This is the wildest story I've heard in a long time. Mr. Muralidhar found an abandoned dog about 1.5 years ago and adopted it. It had a collar, hated cats and seems the previous owner used to take him on his scooter, because Jimmy (that's what Muralidhar named it) would jump on to any parked scooter and sit in the front.

This morning, I see Muralidhar on his walk with Jimmy and he's talking to 2 pretty young girls on bicycles (and I'm thinking how smooth Muralidhar is). It turns out that these girls live in Koramangala and were just cycling in our area today. As they passed Muralidhar, they stopped and one of the girls shouts out "Jimmy" and Jimmy bounds to her. The story is that Jimmy was always a stray and lived in Koramangala near this girl's house.  The residents used to feed him. This girl would take Jimmy for a ride on her scooter once in a way, hence he knew how to sit on one.  And the other wild coincidence - he was called Jimmy there too! Sometimes it pays to use the most common name for dogs -  Jimmy and Julie. 
I still can't believe this
5/11/19, 12:53 PM - le nyom: muralidhar is my neighbour
5/11/19, 12:54 PM - uv: Jimmy is so cute
5/11/19, 12:54 PM - uv: when I just saw it through my notifications I saw the picture of the girls and the dog and the words Mr Muralidhar
5/11/19, 12:54 PM - uv: so I thought that's what the dog's name was
5/11/19, 12:55 PM - le nyom: that's so funny
5/11/19, 12:55 PM - le nyom: how do you see the picture in your notifs
5/11/19, 12:56 PM - uv: can you not

5/16/19, 6:08 PM - uv: and you're a lot more experienced than he is so he's probably nervous as well
5/16/19, 6:08 PM - uv: I really really doubt it has anything to do with the way you look
5/16/19, 6:09 PM - le nyom: sigh ok

6/4/19, 1:37 AM - le nyom: haha
6/4/19, 1:38 AM - uv: haha
6/4/19, 1:47 AM - le nyom: ok
6/4/19, 1:54 AM - le nyom: I'm so confused
6/4/19, 1:54 AM - le nyom: do y'all even talk
6/4/19, 1:54 AM - le nyom: what
6/4/19, 1:54 AM - uv: we're going to watch a movie in the next few days
6/4/19, 1:54 AM - uv: she's the worst texter I've ever met
6/4/19, 1:55 AM - uv: but this talking this is the reason I'm saying if it works out
6/4/19, 1:55 AM - uv: because I am an
6/4/19, 1:55 AM - uv: amazing texter
6/4/19, 1:55 AM - le nyom: oh okay nice
6/4/19, 1:55 AM - le nyom: are you really
6/4/19, 1:55 AM - uv: yes
6/4/19, 1:55 AM - le nyom: also when did this exclusivity thing happen
6/4/19, 1:55 AM - uv: but ya it's this talking thing that's bothering me
6/4/19, 1:55 AM - uv: because if we don't talk enough either in person or over text
6/4/19, 1:55 AM - uv: ?? how does that work at all
6/4/19, 1:56 AM - uv: it's always been the case
6/4/19, 1:56 AM - le nyom: yeah but like I only remember y'all having one discussion
6/4/19, 1:56 AM - le nyom: and that was it
6/4/19, 1:56 AM - le nyom: like no proper interaction after that
6/4/19, 1:56 AM - uv: about us or in general
6/4/19, 1:56 AM - le nyom: yeah my point exactly
6/4/19, 1:57 AM - le nyom: both
6/4/19, 1:58 AM - uv: yeah so I'm going to see how the movie etc goes and see how it's working out between us
6/4/19, 1:58 AM - uv: and if that's fine I'll talk to her about the texting thing again
6/4/19, 1:58 AM - le nyom: yes good plan
6/4/19, 1:58 AM - uv: again because
6/4/19, 1:58 AM - le nyom: is the movie going to be just two
6/4/19, 1:59 AM - le nyom: you two
6/4/19, 1:59 AM - uv: well that is the plan
6/4/19, 2:00 AM - uv: though I wouldn't be surprised if Mahir popped up ü§™ü§™
6/4/19, 2:00 AM - uv: [04/05, 8:57 pm] uv: well one of the things that I think wasn't so great about how it went last time was that towards the end we weren't talking to each other all that much beyond when we were physically next to each other
[04/05, 8:57 pm] uv: so I think that even for a 50% thing the amount we talk to each other should be more than it was towards the end there and more than it is now
[04/05, 8:57 pm] uv: what do you think
[04/05, 9:49 pm] Shreya Anand: I think you are right
[04/05, 9:51 pm] uv: so what do you think the solution is
[04/05, 9:51 pm] uv: is it texting more or calling every so often or what
[04/05, 9:51 pm] uv: since I know you're not a big fan of texting my guess is calling
[05/05, 1:14 pm] Shreya Anand: No that‚Äôs not it 
I don‚Äôt mind texting
[05/05, 1:14 pm] Shreya Anand: But I think it‚Äôs more what we talk about that matters rather than how much we talk
[05/05, 1:36 pm] uv: what do you mean
[05/05, 1:37 pm] uv: I mean like what sort of stuff would you rather be talking about or do you think we should be talking about
[05/05, 8:01 pm] Shreya Anand: What I mean is
[05/05, 8:02 pm] Shreya Anand: It doesn‚Äôt matter how often we text if it‚Äôs just 
Hi 
Hey 
What‚Äôs up
Nm u?
Nm
[05/05, 8:02 pm] Shreya Anand: Ygm ?
[05/05, 8:08 pm] uv: well yeah
[05/05, 8:08 pm] uv: though I don't think I've had a conversation where someone says nm in many many years
[05/05, 8:08 pm] uv: but point taken
[05/05, 8:09 pm] uv: but this doesn't answer the problem of us not talking that much
[06/05, 4:10 pm] Shreya Anand: You know what I mean üòí
[06/05, 4:10 pm] Shreya Anand: I mean from my part I guess I‚Äôll try and text more
[06/05, 4:30 pm] uv: I can picture you saying it though
[06/05, 4:30 pm] uv: see but the thing is
[06/05, 4:30 pm] uv: this conversation that we're having is reasonably
[06/05, 4:30 pm] uv: significant
[06/05, 4:30 pm] uv: and not something like this
[06/05, 4:31 pm] uv: and there's still a huge gap between messages
[06/05, 4:43 pm] Shreya Anand: I said I‚Äôll try
[06/05, 4:44 pm] Shreya Anand: But what would you prefer I do
[06/05, 4:59 pm] uv: well I can work with trying
[06/05, 5:35 pm] Shreya Anand: Okay I guess
[06/05, 5:37 pm] uv: the reason I thought calls might be better was because you'd previously said that you were a calling person
6/4/19, 2:00 AM - uv: and her texting has improved sporadically but there was also recently a three day gap between whatsapp messages ü§©ü§©
6/4/19, 2:00 AM - uv: so it's a struggle
6/4/19, 2:04 AM - le nyom: she's 100% someone that would say nm you
6/4/19, 2:04 AM - le nyom: get some üëåüèΩüëåüèΩüëåüèΩ
6/4/19, 2:04 AM - uv: big time

6/4/19, 2:04 AM - le nyom: well at least she's trying
6/4/19, 2:04 AM - le nyom: yes

6/4/19, 2:06 AM - le nyom: OH YKNOW IF THE ELTON JOHN PLAN DOESN'T WORK OUT
6/4/19, 2:06 AM - uv: no we're just going to ask them to project pictures of Will Smith actually
6/4/19, 2:06 AM - uv: but blue
6/4/19, 2:06 AM - le nyom: EELTONJOHN SHOULD GO FOR IT

6/4/19, 2:08 AM - le nyom: yeah but

6/7/19, 12:14 PM - uv: Please read it. Do not delete. Very Informative.
*IMPORTANT INFORMATION : MUST SHARE !!!!*

A 21 year old girl  wore  a pair of contact lenses
during a barbecue party..

While barbecuing she was directly in contact with the hot smoke of the fire charcoals continuously for 2-3 minutes.

In a few seconds, she started screaming for help & was continuously rubbing her eyes!
No one in the party could understand why  she was  doing this?

Then she was admitted to hospital where the doctor explained
she'll be blind permanently because of the contact
lenses that she had worn.

Contact lenses are made by fibre and the heat
from the charcoal melted her contact lenses.

*DO NOT WEAR CONTACT LENSES OVER HEATING AND FLAMES* or while COOKING

*Friends if u feel the information is important, Please
SHARE this message with  all your  dear ones who use contact lenses*

6/7/19, 1:04 PM - uv: It's true. A sympathetic gay couple have sheltered me in their attic for the last 5 days. The gaystapo came yesterday and interrogated my benefactors, but they didn't search the house. At least not this time.

I'm putting them in terrible danger, but I don't know what else to do. I know what happens to those who protect breeders. They know it too. How long will the be willing to risk their lives for me? I trust them; I have to. What happens when the closet police come back, though? What happens when they are forced to choose between their safety and mine? I pray it doesn't come to that.

A crowd was marching in the street today. I could hear then chanting "YASS QUEEN, YASS QUEEN" through the walls of my hiding place. I can't tell if it's the stomp of their thigh high boots or my own shaking, but it feels like an earthquake. An earthquake inside my own head... my god, there's so many of them. I need to stay positive, but I can feel the spidery thread of hope slipping through my fingers.

Why didn't I listen after homonacht? I could have left. There was still time, but I didn't listen. There's no escape now; only hiding. Hiding and waiting for Pride Month to be over.

6/15/19, 7:02 PM - le nyom: nope
6/15/19, 7:02 PM - le nyom: but they said it's a recent thing
6/15/19, 7:02 PM - le nyom: like it hasn't been developing over the years types
6/15/19, 7:20 PM - uv: I don't know if that's good or bad
6/15/19, 7:22 PM - le nyom: me neither
6/15/19, 7:30 PM - uv: well the good thing is that it's still likely she'll be fine

6/15/19, 9:10 PM - le nyom: yes indeed
6/15/19, 9:11 PM - uv: are you 4'9" or 4'11"
6/15/19, 9:11 PM - uv: the former seems too small
6/15/19, 9:14 PM - le nyom: I thought I was 4'11"
6/15/19, 9:14 PM - le nyom: but I'm not
6/15/19, 9:14 PM - le nyom: they said 149 cm
6/15/19, 9:14 PM - le nyom: oh that's not even 4'9"
6/15/19, 9:15 PM - le nyom: it's less
6/15/19, 9:15 PM - uv: according to Google it's 4'10.7"
6/15/19, 9:15 PM - uv: what weird conversion are you looking at
6/15/19, 9:17 PM - le nyom: oh ya it is

6/15/19, 11:06 PM - le nyom: i know it's really dramatic but like
6/15/19, 11:06 PM - le nyom: I literally cannot imagine my life without sop
6/15/19, 11:07 PM - uv: yeah I get it
6/15/19, 11:08 PM - uv: but the good thing is that the odds are hugely in her favour
6/15/19, 11:08 PM - uv: the doctors said that they think she'll get better with a few days of iv so it's quite likely that that will be the case
6/15/19, 11:08 PM - le nyom: I hope so
6/15/19, 11:09 PM - uv: and even if that doesn't happen and she's on dialysis then it won't be as good but she'll still be healthy and alive for many years to come
6/15/19, 11:11 PM - le nyom: also
6/15/19, 11:11 PM - le nyom: dialysis is super expensive and vets always recommend putting the dog down
6/15/19, 11:15 PM - uv: is it painful for the dog
6/15/19, 11:15 PM - le nyom: yeah
6/15/19, 11:16 PM - le nyom: sigh she's so young im

6/15/19, 11:20 PM - le nyom: hshshshsbshbs
6/15/19, 11:20 PM - le nyom: fuck this
6/15/19, 11:21 PM - uv: I can distract you with more of my own life
6/15/19, 11:21 PM - uv: if you are so inclined
6/15/19, 11:22 PM - le nyom: yes pls
6/15/19, 11:23 PM - uv: [15/06, 10:44 pm] massive: How could you not tell me about spin the bottle

6/16/19, 3:34 PM - le nyom: nothing we just did one more round of iv
6/16/19, 3:34 PM - le nyom: tomorrow they'll redo the tests
6/16/19, 3:35 PM - uv: ah
6/16/19, 3:35 PM - uv: what's the delay between taking the test and getting the results
6/16/19, 3:38 PM - le nyom: just a few hours
6/16/19, 3:39 PM - le nyom: so they'll probably take a blood sample before we start iv and by the time we're done we'll know if she's getting better
6/16/19, 4:36 PM - uv: hm
6/16/19, 4:37 PM - uv: well at least you won't have to deal with the stress of not knowing for much longer
6/16/19, 5:31 PM - le nyom: yeah sigh

[6/17, 1:38 AM] Samara Chandavarkar: shitty that you think I didn't have actual feelings for you
[6/17, 2:01 AM] Pussy Pat: Samara I really need you to understand
[6/17, 2:02 AM] Pussy Pat: I'm sorry I do really love you still
[6/17, 2:03 AM] Pussy Pat: And I don't think that you didn't have feelings for me
[6/17, 2:05 AM] Pussy Pat: And wtv you heard from me or malavika
[6/17, 2:05 AM] Pussy Pat: It's not what you think
[6/17, 2:06 AM] Pussy Pat: I honestly didn't even tell anyone we broke up for a while
[6/17, 2:06 AM] Pussy Pat: Coz I really couldn't
[6/17, 2:07 AM] Pussy Pat: But anyone who asks when I don't even wanna talk about it
[6/17, 2:07 AM] Pussy Pat: I say I fucked up
6/17/19, 9:39 AM - le nyom: I don't understand
6/17/19, 9:39 AM - le nyom: why is he saying he fucked up I thought it was a mutual thing
6/17/19, 9:44 AM - uv: did you ask him
6/17/19, 9:46 AM - le nyom: yeah he hasn't replied yet

[6/17, 9:02 AM] Samara Chandavarkar: okay
[6/17, 9:10 AM] Samara Chandavarkar: but you didn't fuck up??
[6/17, 9:11 AM] Samara Chandavarkar: I thought it was a mutual thing and we both agreed on it but apparently not?
[6/17, 11:38 AM] Pussy Pat: Yeah it was
6/17/19, 11:40 AM - le nyom: okay
6/17/19, 11:44 AM - le nyom: [6/17, 11:38 AM] Pussy Pat: Yeah it was
[6/17, 11:39 AM] Pussy Pat: Listen this is gonna sound cliche and dumb but wtv you heard or think is not true
[6/17, 11:40 AM] Pussy Pat: I'm so happy that we're friends and that we're fine 
You don't understand what that means to me
[6/17, 11:44 AM] Samara Chandavarkar: okay pat
6/17/19, 12:43 PM - le nyom: [6/17, 11:44 AM] Samara Chandavarkar: okay pat
[6/17, 11:44 AM] Samara Chandavarkar: if you say so I guess
[6/17, 11:49 AM] Pussy Pat: What did you hear or think?
[6/17, 11:49 AM] Pussy Pat: Why did you say that? 
I never said that
[6/17, 12:01 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: yeah I shouldn't have said anything
[6/17, 12:01 PM] Pussy Pat: No I mean
[6/17, 12:10 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: you mean?
[6/17, 12:17 PM] Pussy Pat: Like I wasn't saying that aggressively 
I genuinely wanted to know
[6/17, 12:18 PM] Pussy Pat: I may have probably said it but I promise I never meant or thought it to be true
[6/17, 12:22 PM] Pussy Pat: You can say anything, especially if you feel one of us did or said something wrong
[6/17, 12:24 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: it's okay mate if you didn't think I was genuine about my feelings then you didn't, I don't blame you I'm not that great at expressing myself
[6/17, 12:24 PM] Pussy Pat: But that's really not the case
[6/17, 12:25 PM] Pussy Pat: Idek how this came up
[6/17, 12:26 PM] Pussy Pat: But that's not imp
[6/17, 12:28 PM] Pussy Pat: This is such bad timing for you I'm really sorry this came up now 
I wish you the best of luck 
Later when things are better and if you're up to it I'd love to clear things up and I really hope this doesn't ruin our friendship
[6/17, 12:29 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: yeah don't worry about it
[6/17, 12:29 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: I hope it doesn't either sigh
[6/17, 12:30 PM] Pussy Pat: Okay thank you thats great for now
6/17/19, 1:56 PM - le nyom: [6/17, 1:31 PM] Pussy Pat: Okay Samara I spoke to malavika about what me and her spoke about on the terrace and I understand the situation
She was encouraging me to talk to you about getting back together 
And I said I don't think she feels the same way about me now as compared to how I feel about her 
I'm assuming that's what you meant when you said that I thought you didn't have actual feelings for me 
I never felt like you didn't have feelings for me while we were dating, and if I did feel that I would never say anything to someone else before talking about it to you 
I'm sorry I can't imagine what you were feeling or thought when you heard me and malavika speaking, but you heard out of context or maybe misheard
[6/17, 1:52 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: no it's not that she just said
[6/17, 1:52 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: 'it's pretty clear that he thinks he's more invested in this than you were'
[6/17, 1:53 PM] Samara Chandavarkar: that's all dw it's not a big deal
6/17/19, 1:56 PM - le nyom: WHY IS HE MAKING THIS SUCH A BIG THING
6/17/19, 5:29 PM - uv: because he feels like he's offended you
6/17/19, 5:29 PM - uv: so he's trying to clear it up
6/17/19, 5:31 PM - le nyom: nice
6/17/19, 5:35 PM - uv: is it
6/17/19, 7:18 PM - le nyom: I guess

7/10/19, 9:42 PM - uv: Fan fiction is a thing, right? And, let's be honest, we all secretly love this kinda thing! O, to relive those Microsoft '95 nights spent reading semi-romantic Legend of Zelda fan fiction... What compels us to reinvent the stories we're already attached to? The texts we might consider fan fiction exist on a spectrum somewhere between high literary and kitsch, between Milton and My Immortal. If not a proper genre, let's imagine that fan fiction is a particular (perhaps ancient) practice of literary mimesis. The question is whether it's possible to create a wholly original derivative.

10/10/19, 9:01 AM - uv: To be sure, we do not claim that the material conditional is accurate to all uses of "if-then". In particular, a conditional whose antecedent is in the subjunctive mood cannot be ana¬≠lyzed as a material conditional. Prominent among subjunc¬≠tive conditionals are the counterfactual ones.
10/10/19, 9:01 AM - uv: what on god's good earth does this mean

11/5/19, 12:22 AM - le nyom: but sure why not
11/5/19, 12:23 AM - uv: no I mean for example if you this were to exist at Manipal
11/5/19, 12:23 AM - uv: do you think there'd be much of a market for it
11/5/19, 12:24 AM - le nyom: yeah definitely
11/5/19, 12:24 AM - uv: because I've realised that when listening to Belinda and when watching top gear/the grand tour
11/5/19, 12:24 AM - uv: a big part of what makes them great is just the conversations between the people
11/5/19, 12:24 AM - uv: and if that already existed at Brown I'd listen to it
11/5/19, 12:24 AM - le nyom: we have this under25manipal page where people submit stuff
11/5/19, 12:24 AM - le nyom: it's not a podcast but ya I guess if there were one it would be interesting

We are running the Three-Day Relationship Program because we think that Brown students find it hard to commit to relationships (or anything!), so we wish to create a memorable, potentially committed, three day experience at Brown where we will match you with someone to become couples for three days and design fun dating tasks for you to finish. There‚Äôs an option to just meet friends, too! All your info will be kept confidential unless you agree to be interviewed by us afterwards for feedback. We will send matching results by November 19th!

12/28/19, 11:07 AM - uv: weird
12/28/19, 11:08 AM - uv: I don't know how to feel about it

12/28/19, 11:29 AM - le nyom: yeah obviously
12/28/19, 11:30 AM - le nyom: it's rather tell her when she asks me rather than it affecting our friendship later

1/10/20, 9:34 PM - le nyom: so when will you be back in the us
1/10/20, 9:35 PM - uv: I can take those two weeks whenever
1/10/20, 9:35 PM - uv: but consider this
1/10/20, 9:35 PM - uv: come to Providence
1/10/20, 9:35 PM - uv: üòöüòö
1/10/20, 9:35 PM - le nyom: I'll only try for us visa if the Canadian one comes early
1/10/20, 9:35 PM - le nyom: and if i have time to make a trip there at all
1/10/20, 9:35 PM - uv: plz
1/10/20, 9:36 PM - le nyom: yes visa is problem
1/10/20, 9:37 PM - uv: :(
1/10/20, 9:38 PM - uv: I can't stay there for three months alone I'll go crazy
1/10/20, 9:38 PM - le nyom: I'll try my best
1/10/20, 9:38 PM - le nyom: if I get the visa then coming there isn't a problem because I can just stay back after my mum leaves
1/10/20, 9:38 PM - le nyom: bc I have enough time
1/10/20, 9:41 PM - uv: very sweet
1/10/20, 9:41 PM - uv: when will you find out re visa
1/10/20, 9:42 PM - le nyom: I think Canada will take two weeks or something
1/10/20, 9:42 PM - le nyom: then maybe a week for schengen
1/10/20, 9:42 PM - le nyom: so feb
1/10/20, 9:42 PM - le nyom: ish
1/10/20, 9:45 PM - uv: I see
1/10/20, 9:46 PM - uv: should I do this or not
1/10/20, 9:46 PM - uv: it'll be an incredible learning experience
1/10/20, 9:46 PM - uv: but I'll only be able to come back for two weeks
1/10/20, 9:47 PM - le nyom: you can't defer or anything?
1/10/20, 9:47 PM - le nyom: because next year you'll be more settled in and stuff it'll be easier to not come back
1/10/20, 9:48 PM - uv: I don't think so
1/10/20, 9:49 PM - uv: I think it's only freshmen who enter this project
1/10/20, 9:49 PM - uv: straight out of our first intro class
1/10/20, 9:50 PM - le nyom: oh dear
1/10/20, 9:50 PM - le nyom: do it
1/10/20, 9:50 PM - le nyom: have you talked to your parents?
1/10/20, 9:50 PM - le nyom: wait did you get it or not
1/10/20, 9:51 PM - le nyom: not or not
1/10/20, 9:51 PM - le nyom: yet
1/10/20, 9:51 PM - uv: depends on whether I successfully complete the mini project
1/10/20, 9:51 PM - uv: but essentially if I complete it I'm guaranteed to be in
1/10/20, 9:51 PM - uv: yeah they said it's up to me
1/10/20, 9:51 PM - uv: as per my understanding
1/10/20, 9:51 PM - le nyom: I think you should do it
1/10/20, 9:51 PM - le nyom: it's a big opportunity
1/10/20, 9:53 PM - uv: it is a big opportunity
1/10/20, 9:53 PM - uv: not one that I'm likely to get anytime soon
1/10/20, 9:53 PM - uv: ever possibly
1/10/20, 9:53 PM - uv: but being away from home while all my friends are off gallivanting is
1/10/20, 9:53 PM - uv: not a tantalising thought
1/10/20, 9:53 PM - le nyom: yeah it will be painful as fuCk but
1/10/20, 9:53 PM - le nyom: short term pain long term gain babaayyy
1/10/20, 9:54 PM - le nyom: but in all seriousness
1/10/20, 9:54 PM - le nyom: you'll regret not taking it
1/10/20, 9:54 PM - le nyom: like later
1/10/20, 9:54 PM - uv: yeah
1/10/20, 9:54 PM - uv: god I hate this
1/10/20, 9:55 PM - uv: if he'd said that I could spend half the summer home and half in Providence I would've taken it in a heartbeat
1/10/20, 9:55 PM - uv: but two weeks is so little
1/10/20, 9:55 PM - le nyom: yeah must be so difficult being so smart üò´
1/10/20, 9:55 PM - le nyom: true
1/10/20, 9:55 PM - le nyom: but you'll manage
1/10/20, 9:55 PM - le nyom: and after that it's only one sem and you're back
1/10/20, 9:55 PM - le nyom: so it's fine
1/10/20, 9:55 PM - le nyom: one sem goes by sO quickly
1/10/20, 9:57 PM - uv: yeah
1/10/20, 9:57 PM - uv: I'll also have to rent my own place and cook my own food ü§üü§ü
1/10/20, 9:57 PM - le nyom: oh dear god
1/10/20, 9:58 PM - le nyom: this will be so expensive
1/10/20, 9:58 PM - le nyom: if you're doing it then I'll 30000% at least try to come visit you
1/10/20, 9:58 PM - uv: yeah
1/10/20, 9:58 PM - le nyom: also I think you should take the two weeks in the end
1/10/20, 9:58 PM - uv: they give us a stipend though
1/10/20, 9:59 PM - uv: hm I was thinking start because it'll give me a break after finals
1/10/20, 9:59 PM - uv: but I was also thinking end because break before semester starts
1/10/20, 9:59 PM - uv: yeet for dilemmas
1/10/20, 9:59 PM - uv: maybe I'll end up taking it in the middle ü§ü
1/10/20, 9:59 PM - le nyom: but you'll have something to look forward to
1/10/20, 9:59 PM - uv: $3500 a month I believe
1/10/20, 9:59 PM - le nyom: and in the end is usually the most fun
1/10/20, 9:59 PM - uv: that's a very good point actually
1/10/20, 9:59 PM - le nyom: oh nice
1/10/20, 9:59 PM - le nyom: thanks I'm full of them
1/10/20, 10:01 PM - uv: it's alright
1/10/20, 10:01 PM - uv: yes if I end up doing it pls try to stay for some time
1/10/20, 10:01 PM - uv: I'll need company
1/10/20, 10:02 PM - le nyom: yes definitely
1/10/20, 10:02 PM - le nyom: I'll cook for you
1/10/20, 10:02 PM - uv: omg ü•∞ü•∞
1/10/20, 10:02 PM - uv: how sweet of you
1/10/20, 10:03 PM - uv: I think my parents will also show up for some time if I end up taking it
1/10/20, 10:03 PM - le nyom: so cute
1/10/20, 10:04 PM - le nyom: I think you should do it it'll be good for you
1/10/20, 10:04 PM - uv: üò´
1/10/20, 10:04 PM - uv: apparently the team is gonna be just six ish people
1/10/20, 10:04 PM - uv: mostly freshmen
1/10/20, 10:06 PM - le nyom: aw it'll be so cute
1/10/20, 10:07 PM - uv: and terrifying
1/10/20, 10:08 PM - le nyom: why

1/10/20, 10:09 PM - uv: we're all dumb
1/10/20, 10:10 PM - le nyom: yeah but
1/10/20, 10:10 PM - le nyom: you're the smartest dumb lads
1/10/20, 10:11 PM - uv: I'll have to pay some 1500 dollars in taxes this year

1/11/20, 6:41 AM - le nyom: ew I was really emo at 11:45 but it has passed let's not talk about this
1/11/20, 8:22 AM - le nyom: a bus from Toronto to providence is more expensive than a flight
1/11/20, 8:22 AM - le nyom: what a time
1/11/20, 8:50 AM - uv: most certainly is not
1/11/20, 12:03 PM - le nyom: it is I just checked

1/11/20, 12:04 PM - uv: oh through dc

1/11/20, 12:04 PM - uv: there are
1/11/20, 12:04 PM - uv: around 300 dollars
1/11/20, 12:05 PM - le nyom: whAt
1/11/20, 12:05 PM - le nyom: no thank you
1/11/20, 12:05 PM - le nyom: the stopover isn't that bad actually
1/11/20, 12:05 PM - le nyom: it's like an hour or something
1/11/20, 12:10 PM - uv: oh that's pretty good
1/11/20, 12:10 PM - uv: I still think bus is marginally cheaper
1/11/20, 12:10 PM - uv: around a hundred dollars
1/11/20, 12:11 PM - uv: but much longer than a flight
1/11/20, 12:11 PM - le nyom: where do you book buses

A very intimate and intense sexual act performed by two uncircumcised men. Guy one pulls his foreskin back and holds it while guy two stretches his open and outward as far as possible over the head and shaft of guy one's penis. Then guy one repeats the procedure as he's releasing all of his foreskin that he was holding back tightly, pulling the opening out and as far down as possible over guy two's penis, making sure guy two's foreskin stays in place. When complete both cockheads are touching tip to tip encased inside of each others foreskin, the duel coverage combined with the moist juices starting to flow from each of them creates a suctioning effect somewhat similar to a fleshlight, helping to hold everything in place while jacking both penises as one, an effect much like that of those chinese finger "handcuffs", allowing quite a bit of masturbating action while easily staying inside of each other. The sensation is so intense that both guys will quite often ejaculate simultaneously, visually filling the foreskin coupling with so much cum you can see it swell to the point of overflow, slowly uncoupling the foreskins and savoring the warm wet sensations, working their still hard penises together with their intermingled juices...

2/2/20, 10:13 AM - uv: couldn't function at all
2/2/20, 10:13 AM - uv: there was a lot of family stuff with her parents getting a divorce
2/2/20, 10:13 AM - uv: and she was genuinely delusional
2/2/20, 10:14 AM - uv: afraid that her father had injected her with a tracker and was watching all her moves and was still in their villa complex
2/2/20, 10:14 AM - uv: and would somehow get her flight to Delhi grounded
2/2/20, 10:15 AM - le nyom: what the fuck
2/2/20, 10:15 AM - le nyom: jesus christ
2/2/20, 10:15 AM - le nyom: is she okay now
2/2/20, 10:15 AM - uv: according to my mother who has seen this sort of stuff before she was displaying exactly the symptoms associated with being delusional
2/2/20, 10:15 AM - uv: she's a lot better now
2/2/20, 10:15 AM - uv: went to a psychologist
2/2/20, 10:15 AM - uv: got medication
2/2/20, 10:15 AM - le nyom: okay good
2/2/20, 10:16 AM - le nyom: jesus that's so scary

2/2/20, 10:17 AM - uv: she believed everything she was saying
2/2/20, 10:18 AM - uv: she'd also barely been eating and got a drip in the hospital

2/2/20, 10:19 AM - uv: at the time
2/2/20, 10:19 AM - uv: I also haven't asked her anything about it since then because I don't want to trigger anything
2/2/20, 10:19 AM - uv: yeah she told me whatever I'm telling you now
2/2/20, 10:23 AM - le nyom: obviously
2/2/20, 10:23 AM - le nyom: yeah makes sense

2/2/20, 10:24 AM - uv: which both my parents and I thought was a terrible idea
2/2/20, 10:24 AM - uv: she should've taken the semester off to recover

2/24/20, 3:35 AM - uv: why
2/24/20, 3:35 AM - uv: they said that if I wanted to I could do my cs stuff for a credit even this semester
2/24/20, 11:40 AM - le nyom: what does that mean
2/24/20, 11:52 AM - uv: my internship thing
2/24/20, 11:52 AM - uv: it's a yearlong thing
2/24/20, 11:52 AM - uv: during the semester I can do it for pay or credit
2/24/20, 11:52 AM - uv: I thought credit wouldn't be allowed this semester since a month has passed already
2/24/20, 11:52 AM - uv: but apparently that's still an option
2/24/20, 11:53 AM - le nyom: oh noice
2/24/20, 11:53 AM - le nyom: and in the summer you'll do it for pay?
2/24/20, 11:54 AM - uv: summer's not a semester so we just get paid a stipend
2/24/20, 12:00 PM - le nyom: ah okay

2/24/20, 12:11 PM - le nyom: if you're not then nicely do it for credits
2/24/20, 12:11 PM - le nyom: or lessen workload and drop a course and do this for credits
2/24/20, 7:57 PM - uv: I'm doing four courses but I'm allowed to do five max
2/24/20, 7:58 PM - uv: but the thing is that a credit for this would mean a month's less work
2/24/20, 7:58 PM - uv: than next semester
2/24/20, 7:59 PM - le nyom: yes that is good then
2/24/20, 8:28 PM - uv: yes but the other side is

2/28/20, 12:32 AM - uv: sounds good
2/28/20, 12:32 AM - uv: it seems pertinent to mention that there is a chance that I may be able to come back to India for a month from May 15 to June 15
2/28/20, 12:32 AM - uv: around that timeframe
2/28/20, 12:32 AM - uv: it's unlikely but possible

2/28/20, 12:33 AM - uv: extremely unlikely though

2/28/20, 12:34 AM - uv: and I get two weeks off from the internship at any time so if I took it right at the start
2/28/20, 12:34 AM - uv: I'd get a month
2/28/20, 12:34 AM - le nyom: rip but
2/28/20, 12:34 AM - uv: but taking it right at the start isn't the best idea
2/28/20, 12:34 AM - le nyom: taking it atthe start

4/1/20, 1:06 PM - le nyom: [01/04, 11:50 AM] +91 97173 19613: Guys, the EB has an important announcement to make.
[01/04, 11:52 AM] Diya MTTN: If it's an April Fools thing, I swear..
[01/04, 12:00 PM] +91 97173 19613: Okay, in all seriousness hear us out before you react. We hope you will understand the gravity of what follows.
[01/04, 12:00 PM] +91 97173 19613: Greetings Crew!

As you are all aware, we have been taking interviews this past week and were hoping to have a board transfer subsequently. We put in a lot of time and effort in the last few days to choose the right set of people who would carry forward MTTN's legacy and ensure that it reaches greater heights. Until now, we felt that the guidance and mentoring you have received from your department heads and senior crew would have been sufficient to prepare you to assume positions of leadership and take on more challenging roles. 

l, however, with great regret and disappointment am having to break this news that we had a hard time naming even a handful of you who could be entrusted with this responsibility. We aren't really sure what went wrong. When our tenure was nearing its end, we had high hopes that you would be able to step up to the occasion, but that was visibly lacking in the interviews. Breaking from the conventional "in-person interviews," we had to conduct them online owing to the unusual circumstances that currently prevail across the world, and we believe that might have been an essential factor in everybody's sub-par performance. Some of you took it extremely casually while others had no vision for where they wanted to see MTTN in the coming years. I could list numerous instances which took us by surprise and more so by extreme dismay. 

MTTN is not like any other club or organisation in town, the pages of which flip customarily every year. While convention dictates that the board shall be renewed on a yearly basis, we have taken a collective decision after extreme deliberation and discussion to delay this indefinitely. We have nurtured this organisation with the utmost care and find it uncomfortable to pass the baton of responsibility to you at this juncture. We hope that the coming few months will provide you with ample opportunities to prove your mettle once again, but until then we will continue under the existing board.

I would also like to bring to your notice that few of our members, including myself will not be able to contribute to the functioning of the organisation from next semester onwards as commitments of internships take precedence. I am hereby stepping down from my position of Managing-Editor with Siri Rajanahally taking my place. Naman Ohri is also being inducted into the Executive-Board in place of Dhruv Pandey, as he was one of the few candidates who showed some potential during the course of the interviews. I hope you continue working harder and do not let this setback deter you from the larger goal and aspirations we collectively have for MTTN as an organisation. As one of my last duties in the capacity of Managing-Editor, I present to you the interim board for 2020. 

Wishing you all the best of luck, will wholeheartedly miss being a part of the crew and each one of you will hold special places in my heart forever! Thank you for everything you have given me in the form of beautiful memories, I'll cherish them till time immemorial. :")

Cheers!

4/20/20, 11:32 PM - uv: until this thing subsides and you can go back to college
4/20/20, 11:32 PM - uv: in the grand scheme of things
4/21/20, 5:58 AM - le nyom: yep I did he said no problem
4/21/20, 8:56 AM - uv: well that's good

4/21/20, 12:16 PM - uv: that's quite painful
4/21/20, 12:16 PM - uv: you'd still be in a suitcase

4/21/20, 9:28 PM - uv: and he's backstage and he says come on let me go up
4/21/20, 9:28 PM - uv: I invented poking
4/21/20, 9:29 PM - uv: and then he has a weird smile like he knows that poking is the most useless thing man has ever known

4/23/20, 1:46 PM - uv: you enjoy photography and you've made it to two board positions in mttn
4/23/20, 1:46 PM - uv: that should count for something

5/1/20, 7:07 PM - le nyom: but I have college work on top of that and sairu doesn't have anything
5/1/20, 7:08 PM - le nyom: and in all honesty it's not equal, it is heAvily leaning towards my side
5/1/20, 7:08 PM - le nyom: my submissions are tomorrow and for one day sairu can't vacuum the house??

5/1/20, 7:08 PM - le nyom: sabotage everything I do that's all

5/1/20, 7:09 PM - le nyom: is left for saira to do pray tell

5/1/20, 7:11 PM - le nyom: MAAM I HAVE NOT COMPLAINED ONCE IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS ABOUT THIS NONSENSE EVEN THOUGH SAIRA IS SITTING ON HER ASS EVERYDAY WHEN I HAVE SO MUCH COLLEGE WORK
5/1/20, 7:12 PM - uv: nice! not a good argument being drawn there

5/1/20, 7:17 PM - uv: yeah it sucks
5/1/20, 7:17 PM - le nyom: and everything I'm studying is just completely fucking useless

5/2/20, 12:36 AM - uv: me too
5/2/20, 12:36 AM - uv: my philosophy paper
5/2/20, 12:36 AM - uv: did not go well
5/2/20, 12:53 AM - le nyom: oh dear
5/2/20, 12:53 AM - le nyom: exam or like
5/2/20, 12:53 AM - le nyom: you're writing it now
5/2/20, 12:53 AM - le nyom: or you wrote it and sent
5/2/20, 1:01 AM - uv: this
5/2/20, 1:01 AM - uv: I need to get a 91 on the final paper to get 90 overall
5/2/20, 1:01 AM - uv: and I don't know what the cutoff for an A is so that's assuming it's 90
5/2/20, 1:02 AM - uv: this doesn't seem so bad but papers count for 80% of our grade and that 20% I'll get for sure
5/2/20, 1:02 AM - uv: well probably for sure
5/2/20, 1:02 AM - uv: so this would be the highest I'd have to get so far
5/2/20, 1:02 AM - uv: eungh
5/2/20, 1:03 AM - le nyom: getting a 91 is usually easy for you though, I think you'll be fine
5/2/20, 1:03 AM - uv: that's the hope
5/2/20, 1:03 AM - uv: but I got an 83 on the last one which is apparently a B-
5/2/20, 1:03 AM - uv: ain't great

5/2/20, 1:04 AM - le nyom: OH ALSO FUNNY STORY after sleeping in every philosophy class, I realised yesterday that the course is called HISTORY OF Indian Philosophy and so my term paper was a rant about colonization
5/2/20, 1:06 AM - uv: I mean I want to get an A
5/2/20, 1:06 AM - uv: history of philosophy sounds
5/2/20, 1:06 AM - uv: very boring
5/2/20, 1:07 AM - le nyom: I actually enjoy it because it's Indian philosophy and it's mostly about white people ducking
5/2/20, 1:07 AM - le nyom: sicking
5/2/20, 1:07 AM - le nyom: SUCKING

5/10/20, 4:47 PM - le nyom: so my mum is such a dickhead
5/10/20, 4:47 PM - le nyom: [10/05, 3:03 pm] Mama: Want to tell you both that I felt hurt today that you didn't care enough to make your mother feel a lil special. I know mother's day is a day encouraged for commerce but its ok right? Feeling a bit overwhelmed by the warmth from my kids esp when you are not here (ok... Done with the sarcasm)

On a serious note...I saw a similar lack of enthusiasm to do something for your father on his 50th. It doesn't hurt right to make people you do care about, feel a little special on some days.. It doesn't take much effort but it would mean so much to someone. If I have brought you up to believe that making someone feel happy or showing that you care is not a big deal .... Then it's not right. Never meant it to be that way. Would be really happy if you could always make that little effort to show someone you care, that they are special or you appreciate them. You would bring a lot of happiness and joy to those who matter in your life.
[10/05, 3:04 pm] Mama: I hope you take this objectively without any bias

[10/05, 4:46 pm] Mama: Am going to be saying sorry for a long time
[10/05, 4:47 pm] Samara Chandavarkar: if material things is how you want us to show appreciation, we will. not everyone's love language is the same but we'll do whatever you want us to.
[10/05, 4:49 pm] Mama: Nope.... Not at all. A cute wish in the morning like that artboard was what would have made my day. I hope you understand
[10/05, 4:49 pm] Mama: I didn't hear from you guys at all until afternoon and it brought me down

[10/05, 4:53 pm] Mama: Sam... Again we are treading very close to being misunderstood by each other... So let's drop it. Appreciate the effort in sending me the cake. Thank you.

5/15/20, 8:04 PM - le nyom: about people

5/15/20, 8:04 PM - le nyom: also everything that's online isn't even talking shit it's completely harmless
5/15/20, 9:59 PM - uv: to be fair there is potential for it to develop into an avenue for cyber bullying
5/15/20, 9:59 PM - uv: but the other reasons
5/15/20, 9:59 PM - uv: like professors being upset with being called cute
5/15/20, 9:59 PM - uv: ... yeah no one's going to care about that
5/15/20, 9:59 PM - uv: oof
5/15/20, 10:00 PM - uv: dammit bhanzuri
5/15/20, 10:00 PM - uv: which is why the page should be moderated
5/15/20, 10:00 PM - le nyom: sure but
5/15/20, 10:00 PM - le nyom: what power do they have
5/15/20, 10:00 PM - le nyom: to moderate an instagram page
5/15/20, 10:01 PM - uv: they as in the student reps?
5/15/20, 10:01 PM - le nyom: yeah
5/15/20, 10:03 PM - uv: it may prove to be a requirement
5/15/20, 10:03 PM - uv: complaints about posts could make their way to the university who may force the students involved to shut it down
5/15/20, 10:03 PM - uv: if the page is moderated
5/15/20, 10:03 PM - uv: then that's far less likely to happen
5/15/20, 10:04 PM - le nyom: no we already got an email for the uni just now about it
5/15/20, 10:04 PM - le nyom: and they sent some ragging thing idk
